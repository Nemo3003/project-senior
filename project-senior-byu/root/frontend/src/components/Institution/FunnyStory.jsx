        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          Once upon a time, there was a small institution that had big dreams. It was founded by a group of friends who wanted to make a difference in the world. They had no money, no experience, and no idea what they were doing, but they had a lot of enthusiasm and a good sense of humor.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          They decided to call their institution the "School of Wacky Wisdom" and they set out to teach the world about the things that really matter, like how to make the perfect cup of coffee, how to dance like a chicken, and how to tell a joke that no one understands.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          At first, no one took them seriously. They had a hard time finding students, and the ones they did find often left in frustration or confusion. But the friends refused to give up. They kept experimenting with new ideas and approaches, always with a smile on their faces and a song in their hearts.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          Slowly but surely, the School of Wacky Wisdom started to gain a following. People from all over the world were drawn to their quirky courses and offbeat teaching style. They became known for their unconventional wisdom and their ability to make even the most serious subjects seem fun and approachable.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          Today, the School of Wacky Wisdom is a thriving institution, with campuses all over the world and a reputation for excellence in education and laughter. It just goes to show that sometimes the best way to change the world is to do it with a smile and a sense of humor.
